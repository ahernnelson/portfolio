description: "I initially came across the two papers in February 2019 talk about viewing single hidden layer networks from a newperspective and the more recent one goes to some serious lengths to formalize the notion and prove a better generalization. Unfortunately, the idea has not led to any new breakthroughs and is effectively dead. Still the idea is cool enough that I made a small poster about it to present to math and CS undergrads. Check the references for the paper"
